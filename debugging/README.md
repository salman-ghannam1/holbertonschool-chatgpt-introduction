# AI-Assisted Code Review & Debugging

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to **improve software quality** by leveraging **ChatGPT** as an intelligent assistant for:
- Detecting programming errors
- Analyzing code logic
- Suggesting fixes and optimizations
- Explaining bugs and design flaws in a clear, human-readable way

The project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can support developers during **debugging, refactoring, and code review** stages.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Reduce time spent on manual debugging  
- Help developers understand **why** a bug occurs, not just how to fix it  
- Improve code readability, performance, and security  
- Provide educational explanations for junior developers  

---

## 🧠 How ChatGPT Is Used
ChatGPT is used as a **software analysis assistant**, not as a replacement for developers.

It helps by:
- Reviewing source code snippets
- Identifying syntax errors, logical bugs, and bad practices
- Suggesting corrected or optimized versions of the code
- Explaining issues step-by-step
- Highlighting potential edge cases or vulnerabilities
